                    <p>
                        Hello again! <br />
                        I'm Grace. I spent the first 18 years of my life in the tropical heat of Bangkok, Thailand, and now I'm studying computer and data science at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.
                        <br />
                        Growing up, I have always loved designing artwork by hand. Combined with my interest in engineering, I decided to pursue computer science, where I can build exciting technology with creative designs.
                        <br />
                        At Penn, I explore diverse interests: I'm a TA for Big Data Analytics, a project lead for pro-bono consulting projects, and a product designer for Penn Spark.
                        <br />
                        In my free time, you can always find me bouldering, curating new playlists, walking my dog (his name is Elon!), or making Trader Joeâ€™s runs for our pop-up restaurant called every now & then.
